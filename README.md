# Hazmat Detection

_The initial code, test images, and final working copy (sifttest5.py) of my hazmat detection code_

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I worked on this project in 2017 before I had any formal coding training so it is a mess. I used the python version of OpenCV 
and the package SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) to match images for a rescue robot competition. sifttest5.py works
with the reference images provided and with a standard raspberry pi camera taking an image of one of the reference images at
any angle. 

If there are any questions about this
